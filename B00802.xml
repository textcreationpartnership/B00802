            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

As for a lamentable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in this beggery and Anti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chriſtian tranſubſtantiation, it is to manifeſt, wherein ſome of our Cleargie, haue moſt wickedli &amp; blindly taught the people of this realme, that they ſhoulde beleue that in that they receiued the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, that they wythout any
<pb facs="tcp:180881:18"/> doubte dyd eate Chriſtes fleſhe &amp; dryncke hys bloude, becauſe (by vertue of the worde ſpoken bi the prieſt) the bread is chaunged into Chriſtes naturall fleſh and bloud wherefore receiuinge and eatyng the breade they ſhoulde eate Chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtes fleſhe and bloud whiche they dyd nothynge leſſe. And ſo were ledde w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a falſe and fayned fayth to truſte to haue by eatynge the ſacramente eternall lyfe, euen for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worcks ſake, or becauſe they eat it w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> theyr teeth whiche onely dyd not profit them but alſo was their vtter da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nation becauſe they recey<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued it wythout fayth.</p>
            <p>NOw Chriſten reader, I truſt thou perceiueſt, that in euery ſacrament. Ther be two thinges to be conſidered, the one is the viſyble ſubſtance, whych is offered, to the ſenſes, &amp; by and wyth the ſenſes, we maye
<pb facs="tcp:180881:18"/> receyue and vſe the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie of it. The other is, the Inuiſible grace, and liberall gifte of God, whych by the viſible ſubſtance &amp; the promyſe of god, vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame Ioyntely pronounced, is repreſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and geuen to al them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and conſtantely, beleue the ſame promeſſe. This ſpirituall gifte of god, is Chriſtes body bro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken and his bloude ſhede, for the remyſſion of our ſynnes, whyche ſpirituall gifte, bycauſe it is g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to vs by godes liberal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes? It can not be otherwiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued, but of a ſpirituall herte, and that thorow, and by, faythe onely, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame promeſſe Suche faythefull beleuers doubtles do eate Chriſtes fleſhe and dryncke his bloude in ſpirite and truthe: That is to ſaye receyue all the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>moditie and profet of all Chriſtes paſſion, death, reſurrection, and
<pb facs="tcp:180881:19"/> aſcention, whych is, remiſſion of ſynnes, and eternall lyfe. In the receyuyng of this ſacrament we profeſſe not onely to be faythfull warriars agaynſt the deuel, the worlde, and the fleſhe, but alſo to be lyuely membres, of Chriſtes myſticall body, wherof Chriſte is heade: wherfore aboue all thinge we muſt be circumſpecte &amp; wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we defile not oure ſelues wyth any fylthy luſtes &amp; ſynnes wherby we ſhoulde be become a-fylthy, croked, and roten, mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber wherof out head Ieſu Chriſt ſhoulde not reioyce, but rather be a ſhamed, and ſo worthi to be cut of from the body. And then euen as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> brau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tree whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is cut of from the tre, receyueth nor ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth any more ſappe iuyſe or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall moyeſtnes of the tree, and therfore widdereth, dryeth and becometh deade, apte only for the fyer. In like maner if we thorow

Of the other parte if we be faythfull warriars of Chriſt, and ſtriue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly againſt the deuel, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world and the fleſhe, and beleue faythe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully that by and thorow Chriſte we ſhall ouercome the ſame, we ſhall doubteles be accepted and reputed and taken before god as
